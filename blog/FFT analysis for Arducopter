Notes from setting up filters on arducopter platform:


Setup for logging:
Capture the data: Under FFT setup enable IMU 1 and 1024(1khz) or 2Khz if the board is capable of it.(cube orange)

For log bitmask keep the default (disable raw IMU, video stabilization)

INS_LOG_BAT_OPT =5 (check sensor rate logging and sample pre and post filter)

Set Harmonic notches:
INS_HNTCH_ENABLE =1
INS_HNTCH_HMNCS =1 at the fundamental frequency or (more for harmonics 1 and 2)


Setup Dynmaic FFT (if no RPM)

Gyro LP filter:
Tuning goal is to increase the cutoff freq. of the LP filter as high as possible without allowing noise to come through. Especially 
the fundamental motor frequency or frame resonance. LP is better suited for high freq noise rather than dealing with the peaks.


without any filtering:
