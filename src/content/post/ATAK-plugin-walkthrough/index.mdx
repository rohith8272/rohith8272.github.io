This short guide walks through the minimal steps to build and install a simple **HelloWorld** ATAK 
plugin using the **ATAK-CIV SDK**. It assumes you have a working development machine and some basic Android Studio experience.

## Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have:

**Android Studio** (latest stable version)  
[Download from developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)  
**Android SDK Platform 21** (Android 5.0 / Lollipop)  
ATAK requires **API level 21** or higher.  
**ATAK-CIV SDK**  
[GitHub – deptofdefense/AndroidTacticalAssaultKit-CIV](https://github.com/deptofdefense/AndroidTacticalAssaultKit-CIV)


## 1. Install Android Studio

Download and install Android Studio using the default installer for your OS.  
Then open the **SDK Manager** and ensure that **API level 21** (Android 5.0) is installed.

> 💡 Even if you already have newer SDKs, API 21 is required for ATAK builds.

## 2. Clone the ATAK SDK

Clone or download the official ATAK-CIV repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deptofdefense/AndroidTacticalAssaultKit-CIV.git
```
Inside this repo, locate the plugin-examples folder — it includes several working examples, including HelloWorld.

## 3. Copy the HelloWorld Example

Copy the helloworld example from the SDK into your working plugins folder, or open it directly in Android Studio.


The HelloWorld plugin is a good starting point because it demonstrates the basic structure of an ATAK plugin project.
