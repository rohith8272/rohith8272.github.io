# 👋 Hi, I'm Rohith Maben

Welcome to my personal website! I'm an aeronautical engineer, and this site is a hub for my projects, technical blogs, and academic publications.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- [**DroneSim**](https://dronesim.xyz): A cloud based UAV simulator for ardupilot and PX4 vehicles. Sign up, spin up a container and connect to your favorite ground station.
- [**Log Analyzer for ArduPilot**](/projects/log-analyzer): A tool to gain insights from flight log data and generate reports.
- [**Thanos-UAV Conceptual design tool**](/projects/log-analyzer): Fast design and performance evalulation tool for small unmanned fixed wing aircrafts.
